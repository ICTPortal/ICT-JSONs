Higher amount of data it becomes difficult to keep in our memory. On such occasions writing these data is one method. That is called manual database. The other method is to maintain data on an electronic medium. This is called an electronic database. Data can be retrieved efficiently when needed if it is saved in a database in a systematic way. Hence, database is needed to save a large amount of data and to retrieve them very efficiently. Examples: A telephone book (Manual) or a phone directory (Electronic)."
