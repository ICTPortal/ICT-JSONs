Sri Lankan ICT Textbooks JSON
=============================

This repository contains **Sri Lankan Grade 10 and 11 ICT textbooks in JSON format**.  
Each chapter, section, and lesson is structured so developers, web/app creators, or AI projects can **use it directly**.

The JSON files include:

- Chapters, sections, and subsections
- Definitions, concepts, examples, activities
- Lists, paragraphs
- Learning objectives and summaries

 subsections
- Definitions, concepts, examples, activities
- Lists, paragraphs, history, and computer generations
- Learning objectives and summaries

It’s essentially the textbook content converted into structured JSON, ready to use in applications, websites, or models.

Resources
=========

The textbook content is based on official Sri Lankan ICT textbooks and online resources:

- e-Thaksalawa ICT Textbooks: https://e-thaksalawa.moe.gov.lk
- Other publicly available ICT resources and PDFs

A 'resources' folder in this repo contains the textbook PDFs for reference.

JSON Structure
===============

Each chapter has its own JSON file, structured like this:

- document_info: Title, language
- chapter_content: chapter number, learning objectives, sections
- sections: each section or subsection with content
- content inside sections: definitions, concepts, examples, activities, lists, paragraphs, history, generations

Example structure (simplified):

    Chapter JSON
    ├── document_info
    ├── chapter_content
    │    ├── chapter_number
    │    ├── learning_objectives
    │    └── sections
    │         ├── id
    │         ├── title
    │         └── content
    │              ├── definition / concept / paragraph
    │              ├── example
    │              ├── list
    │              └── activity

Usage
=====
